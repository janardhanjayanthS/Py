🧠 Requirements
Create a Pydantic model named Book with the following fields:

title: string (must not be empty)
author: string
price: float (must be greater than 0)
published_year: integer (must be between 1900 and the current year)
in_stock: boolean

Create another model named Library that has:
name: string
books: a list of Book objects

When a Book or Library object is created:
Pydantic should automatically validate all the data.
If the data is invalid (e.g., negative price or missing title),
it should raise a ValidationError.

Create one valid example and one invalid example to test your models.

🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Add an extra field isbn in Book:
It must be a string of exactly 13 digits.

Add a method (inside the model) that returns the book’s display name as:
"Title by Author (Year)".
