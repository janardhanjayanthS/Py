# EC2 - Eleastic Compute Cloud
- Infrastructure as a Service -> Provides compute runtime
- Consists of:
    1. Renting virtual machines - EC2 instances
    2. Storing data on virtual drives - EBS volumes
    3. Distribute load across machines (servers) - ELB (elastic load balancer)
    4. Scale services - ASG (Auto Scaling Group)
- Configuring EC2:
    - OS: Win or Linux
    - CPU: power & Cores/Threads
    - RAM: mb/gb
    - Storage:
        - Network attached (EBS & EFS)
        - Hardware attached (EC2 instance store)
    - Network: speed, public IP
    - Firewall: security
