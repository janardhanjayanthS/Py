⚡ Project: AI Book Recommendation & Reading Tracker

A small but real-life useful project:

Chat with an AI that recommends books based on interests

Tracks books you read

Fetches new book suggestions from an open-source database (Open Library API)

🔧 Requirements (no code)

What the project must support
Feature	Concept Covered
Chat-based AI assistant	Models + Messages
Streams while responding	Streaming
Looks up books from Open Library	Tools
A tool implemented through MCP	MCP Tool
Tracks reading history	Memory
Generates structured reading plan	Structured Output
Confirms before writing to history	Human-in-the-loop
Adds behavior like logging tool calls	Middleware
Adjusts prompts based on user interests	Dynamic Prompt
🧩 Minimum Scope (fits in 40 mins)

1. Memory

Store:

favorite genres

favorite authors

current reading list

Use simple JSON or Python list (no database needed but allowed).

2. Tools

Implement two:

Tool Name	Input	Output
SearchBooks	genre or keyword	5 books with title + author + OpenLibrary URI
SaveReadingHistory	book title	success message

3. MCP Tool

A simple MCP wrapper to call Open Library book details lookup:

Input → book title

Output → description, published year, subjects

4. Structured Output

When user says:

"Make a reading plan for me"

Return structured JSON with:

{
  "week": 1,
  "books": [
    {"title": "", "pages_per_day": int},
    ...
  ]
}

5. Agent Customization
Type	Requirement
Middleware	Print tool execution logs + timing
Dynamic Prompt	If user likes mystery → use more “thriller” tone in recommendations
HITL	Ask user "Should I add this to your reading history?" before saving

6. Product Behavior
User Says	System Response
"I love fantasy books"	Save to memory
"Suggest books"	SearchBooks tool
"Tell me about this book"	MCP lookup tool
"Add it to my reading list"	Ask for confirmation → SaveReadingHistory
"Plan 1 month of reading"	Structured output plan
📂 Recommended 40-min Folder Layout

  main.py
  tools.py
  memory.json
  mcp_client.py


(Optional) add a basic CLI or FastAPI route for streaming — not required.

🟢 Why this fits 40 minutes

No frontend required

API access is simple (Open Library = no API key)

Tools are small and fast to implement

Memory is just JSON file or list

No DB setup needed unless you want to extend

When you’re ready, I can provide:
✔ setup steps
✔ file-by-file skeleton code
✔ test checklist

Just say "start" or "give skeleton code" when ready. 🚀
