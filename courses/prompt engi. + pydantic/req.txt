Project Requirements: AI To-Do Assistant
1. Maintain an in-memory list of tasks
Each task must have:
id (int)
task (str)
done (bool)

2. Create Pydantic models
AddTaskInput(task: str)
MarkDoneInput(task_id: int)
ListTasksInput() (empty)

3. Define three tools
add_task → adds a new task
list_tasks → returns all tasks
mark_done → marks a task as completed
Each tool must use its corresponding Pydantic model.

4. System prompt requirements
Assistant is a to-do manager
Must use tool calling when adding/listing/updating tasks
Must ask for clarification if user input is unclear
Must not invent tasks

5. LLM workflow
Send user message + system prompt + tool specs
LLM picks a tool and outputs arguments
Validate with Pydantic
Execute tool
Send tool result back to LLM
LLM generates final answer
